This is a simple demo that shows how to handle large number of markers by using utils library, clustering. 
There are two modules:  
* app: Kotlin implementation
* java: Java implementation

A thorough explanation can be found in the post [here](http://mobiledevhub.com/2018/11/16/android-how-to-group-and-cluster-markers-in-google-maps/).  
NOTE: In order to use this code, you need to create an API key for Google Maps from https://console.developers.google.com. 
Once you generate the key, you need to add it in **google_maps_api_key.xml** located **res -> values**
